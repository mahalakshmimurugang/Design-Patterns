# Design_Patterns
This repository provides simple, understandable, and practical examples of commonly used Design Patterns in Java. These patterns are categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, based on the classic Gang of Four (GoF) classification.

Why Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. They provide a shared vocabulary among developers and help in writing flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. This repository is curated for learners, interview preparation, and developers aiming to improve their software architecture.

What’s Included?
🔨 Creational Patterns (Object Creation)
Singleton – Ensures a class has only one instance

Factory Method – Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic

Abstract Factory – Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

Builder – Constructs complex objects step-by-step

Prototype – Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch

🧱 Structural Patterns (Class & Object Composition)
Adapter – Converts one interface into another that a client expects

Decorator – Dynamically adds behavior or responsibilities to objects

Composite – Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly

Facade – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem

Proxy – Acts as a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object

🔁 Behavioral Patterns (Object Interaction)
Strategy – Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and selects them at runtime

Observer – Automatically notifies dependent objects when state changes

Command – Encapsulates a request as an object for parameterization and queuing

Iterator – Provides a standard way to traverse elements of a collection

State – Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes

Template Method – Defines the program skeleton, letting subclasses fill in steps

Chain of Responsibility – Passes a request along a chain of handlers

Mediator – Centralizes complex communication and control between objects

Visitor – Allows adding operations to objects without changing their class

Memento – Captures and restores an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation
